# SharkExpression

SharkExpression is a lightweight and flexible mathematical expression evaluator.
It has been designed to have reusable and performance-focused Expressions once parsed,
with varying variable values, externally supplied by the user application.

## Features

* Unary, binary, and ternary operators.
* Functions.
* Expression syntax validation, with precise error list for string highlighting.
* Parameterizable grammar rules.
* Reusable pre-parsed Expression objects.
* Externally supplied varying variable values.
* Pre-computing of eventual full-of-constants expression parts.
* Use of code point characters, because there is more than the english alphabet in this world ;-) .
